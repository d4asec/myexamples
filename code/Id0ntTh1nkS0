hello there...
just wanted to let you know that...
I don't think it is wise to publish...
your company's secret schematics over GitHub...
you should be more carefull...
next time...
I will notify your management folks...
to avoid any security issues...
hope you understand...
and also...
hope this won't get you into...
any trouble...
I know this is a big day for your company...
we don't want anything to interfere with it...
do we?...
EOL
